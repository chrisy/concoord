Installing ConCoord
===================
For the purposes of this document, we will need a working copy of
ConCoord. There are two ways of installing the most recent version of
the system: from precompiled binaries, or from source.

Requirements
------------------------
The minimum requirements for ConCoord are:

* python 2.6.6 or later
* dnspython-1.9.4

Installing Precompiled Binaries
------------------------
The easiest way to install ConCoord is through the precompiled
packages. The ConCoord distribution currently supports Debian, Ubuntu
and Fedora.

The precompiled binaries have the necessary dependencies built into
them so installing them should pull in all other required components.

Installing From Source
------------------------
It is very easy to build ConCoord from source. Once youâ€™ve installed
all of the prerequisites, you can build and install ConCoord with:

.. sourcecode:: console

      	    $ python setup.py install
