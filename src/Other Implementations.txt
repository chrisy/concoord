** Toy Paxos (Python)
[http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/?p=190]

    - Leader and Acceptor are implemented
    - PaxosLeader listens for proposals from external clients and 
    runs the protocol with whichever PaxosAcceptors are currently
    correct/connected

    - If a leader fails, another leader will take over once it realises. 
    If clients fail, the protcol will still run until more than half have 
    failed.

    - Heartbeats are used to do weak Leader Election.

    - GarbageCollection: If a proposal is accepted it is removed.

    - Leader & Acceptor run following a state machine.

** Lib Paxos (C)
[http://libpaxos.sourceforge.net/]
    - 5 Different Implementations:
      		  -- RingPaxos: a high-throughput implementation based on IP-Mmulticast
		  -- libPaxos2 : libPaxos with leader election and various protocol optimizations
		  -- libPaxos   : basic implementation
		  -- fastPaxos : fast paxos algorithm
		  -- erlangPxs : simulator written in Erlang

      --- fastPaxos
      	  - disk writes to keep state


** pyPaxos (Python)
[http://evanjones.ca/model-checking-paxos.html]
    - basic paxos algorithm
    - algorithm tested by model checking
    - brute force testing using orderings
      	    - employing different partial orders
