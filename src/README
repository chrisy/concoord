(1) INTRODUCTION
----------------
	ConCoord is a novel coordination service that provides
	replication and synchronization support for large-scale
	distributed systems. ConCoord employs an object-oriented
	approach, in which the system actively creates and maintains
	live replicas for user-provided objects. Through ConCoord, the
	clients are able to access these replicated objects
	transparently as if they are local objects. The ConCoord
	approach proposes using these replicated objects to implement
	coordination constructs in large-scale distributed systems, in
	effect establishing a transparent way of providing a
	coordination service.

(2) REQUIREMENTS
----------------
	The minimum requirements for ConCoord are:

	- python 2.6.6 or later
	- dnspython-1.9.4

(2) INSTALLATION
----------------
	To build and install concoord, type 	

      	    $ python setup.py install

(3) USAGE
----------------
	To use concoord, first you need to create the local python
	object to represent the state you want to replicate. To walk
	you through the concoord approach, we will use the following
	Counter object saved under /foo/counter.py:

	class Counter():
	    def __init__(self):
            	self.value = 0

    	    def decrement(self):
                self.value -= 1

    	    def increment(self):
                self.value += 1

	    def getvalue(self):
                return self.value
    
	    def __str__(self):
            	return "The counter value is %d" % self.value

(3.1) concoordify python objects    
	To create concoord objects (to be used by the client and the
	server) you can use:

	$ concoord object -p /foo/counter.py -n Counter

	where objectpath:= path of the object you want to concoordify
      	      classname := name of the class that you'll use to access your object	   

        This script will create two files under the directory that the
        object resides (i.e. `/foo`):

       	    * `/foo/counter.pyfixed`:= the object that can be used on the
              server side by replicas and nameservers

	    * `/foo/counter.pyproxy`:= the proxy that can be used like
              the original object by the client

        Remember to rename the files back to the original filename
      	before you import them on the client or server side. To avoid
      	confusion, we will name them counter.py and counterproxy.py in
      	this tutorial.

	    $ mv /foo/counter.pyfixed ~/objects/counter.py
	    $ mv /foo/counter.pyproxy ~/objects/counterproxy.py

	Once you have created the objects, update your PYTHONPATH
	accordingly, so that the objects can be found and imported:

	    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/objects/

(3.2) start system manually
        To start the system you need to start at least one replica, one
        acceptor and one nameserver node. Once the nameserver node is
        started you can send dig queries to the nameserver and learn the
      	node to bootstrap, current set of nodes and current set of
      	replicas.

	* For bootstrapping concoord requires at least one replica
        node. If a nameserver node is up, bootstrap can be the
        domainname for the concoord instance as new nodes can retrieve
        the bootstrap node automatically through DNS queries. If the
        nameserver is not running bootstrap is a list of 'ipaddr:port'
        strings.

      	* Note that for the system to be able to add new nodes and accept
      	client requests there has to be at least one replica and one
      	acceptor node present initially.

(3.2.1) start a replica node
	To start the bootstrap replica node manually, use the following command:

	$ concoord replica -f counter.py -c Counter

	Note that you can specify the port the replica binds to by
	option '-p', if not specified port defaults to the first
	available port, starting from 6668.

	To start replica nodes to join an active concoord instance, use the following command:

	$ concoord replica -f counter.py -c Counter -b 'ipaddr:port'

(3.2.2) start an acceptor node
	To start an acceptor node manually, use the following command:

	$ concoord acceptor -b 'ipaddr:port'
	
(3.2.3) start a nameserver node
	To start a nameserver node manually, make sure that you have
	at least one replica and one acceptor running. You can start
	the nameserver to answer queries for 'counterdomain' as follows:

	$ concoord nameserver -n counterdomain -f counter.py -c Counter -b 'ipaddr:port'

	* Note that the command has to be run with su privileges as it
	binds to UDP port 53.

	From this point on, you can send queries for counterdomain and
	see the most current set of nodes:

	$ dig -t a @ipaddr counterdomain		   *returns set of Replicas

	$ dig -t srv @ipaddr _concoord._tcp.counterdomain  *returns set of Replicas with port

	$ dig -t txt @ipaddr counterdomain		   *returns set of all nodes

	$ dig -t ns @ipaddr counterdomain		   *returns set of nameservers

(3.3) start nodes automatically

        We have a script we use for openreplica.org to start desired
        number of nodes on PlanetLab servers automatically. This
        script is included for your reference.

	        concoord/openreplica/openreplicainitializer.py

	* Note that the script requires host and user-specific
	credentials and you will have to edit the script for your own
	use.

	To call the script:

	$ concoord initialize -s counterdomain -f ~/objects/counter.py -c Counter -r 3 -a 3 -n 3

(3.4) add nodes automatically

        We have a script we use for openreplica.org to add nodes on
        PlanetLab servers automatically. This script is included for
        your reference.

             concoord/openreplica/openreplicaaddnode.py

	* Note that the script requires host and user-specific
	credentials and you will have to edit the script for your own
	use.

	To call the script:

	$ concoord addnode -t nodetype -s counterdomain -f ~/objects/counter.py -c Counter -b bootstrap

	where nodetype:= 1 for Acceptor, 2 for Replica, 3 for Nameserver
	      bootstrap:= 'ipaddr:port' or domainname for an instance that has a nameserver

(3.5) using concoord objects

        Once you have concoord up and running for your object, it is
        easy to access your object. 

	Now we will use the proxy object we generated at (3.1) and
        saved under `~/concoordproxy.py`. Now you can import and use
        this proxy object in your code as follows:

	>>> from counterproxy import Counter
	>>> c = Counter('domainname')
	>>> c.increment()
	>>> c.increment()
	>>> c.getvalue()
	2
	>>>

(3.6) creating bundles

      To create bundles to use at the server and client sides you can
      use the Makefile provided under 'concoord/'

      Remember to add the objects you have created in these
      bundles.

(3.6.1) to create a server bundle:

	$ make server

(3.6.2) to create a client bundle:

	$ make client

(3.7) Logging

      We have two kinds of loggers for ConCoord:
      - Console Logger
      - Network Logger

      Both of these loggers are included under utils.py

      To start the NetworkLogger, use the logdaemon.py on the host you
      want to keep the Logger.
