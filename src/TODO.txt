*** CHANGES TO THE CODE ***
ResponseCollector   : 'received' keeps <peer:reply> mappings
		      	       	  upon receiving a reply the Response Collector adds it to 'received'
				  if a reply is coming for the second time it overwrites the old one
				  the length of 'received' determines if quorum is reached or not

Leader			: 'proposals' keeps <commandnumber:proposal> mappings with the 
			  	   highest ballotnumber
				   Leader updates proposals by pMax(possiblepvalueset)
				   Leader goes over all proposals in this dictionary and sends a PROPOSE for each

Replica			 : 'requests' keeps <commandnumber:commandstate> mappings
			  	   'commandstate' can be Executed,Decided,Running,None
				   		  - Executed: The command corresponding to the commandnumber has 
						    	      	     been both decided and executed.
						  - Decided: The command corresponding to the commandnumber has 
						    	     	     been decided but it is not executed yet (probably due to an 
								     outstanding command prior to this command.)
						  - Running: The commandnumber is assigned to a command but the 
						    	     	     result is not known yet.
						  - None: The commandnumber has not been assigned to any command.
			  	   'nextcommandnumber' keeps the commandnumber that should be used for the next proposal
				   'lastexecuted' keeps the commandnumber that has been executed

Node			 : Periodic Liveness Messages should be added: MSG_PING
			   	   



*** TO THINK ABOUT ***
- Messages have 'at least one semantics'; at which points should we check if a message has been received before or not?
- How should the Leader and Replica states be updated so commandnumber allocation is done apropriately.
- Should Leaders extend Replicas? 
- How to make Leader not reissue all previous commands
    -- Leader can have the state that Replica has (especially if the Leader extends a Replica) and not reissue command in the
         Executed (maybe even Decided) state.
    -- Leader can receive periodic "state of the system" messages from Replicas
- How will Leader Failure be handled.
- How will the weak Leader election be done.
