Concepts
========

HyperDex is a distributed, searchable key-value store. The key features of HyperDex are:

 * **Fast**: HyperDex has lower latency, higher throughput, and lower variance than other key-value stores.

 * **Scalable**: HyperDex scales as more machines are added to the system.

 * **Consistent**: HyperDex guarantees linearizability for key-based operations. Thus, it a GET always returns the latest value inserted into the system. Not just "eventually," but immediately and always.

 * **Fault tolerant**: HyperDex automatically replicates data on multiple machines so that concurrent failures, up to an application-determined limit, will not cause data loss.

 * **Searchable**: HyperDex enables lookups of non-primary data attributes. Such searches are implemented efficiently and contact a small number
